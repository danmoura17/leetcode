# LeetCode Practice

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my journey through LeetCode challenges as I prepare for software engineering interviews with big tech companies. Here, I've compiled my solutions to various problems, organized by difficulty and categorized by key concepts and algorithms. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Organization
The repository is organized into three main directories based on problem difficulty - Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each directory contains JavaScript files named according to the LeetCode problem ID and title for easy reference.
